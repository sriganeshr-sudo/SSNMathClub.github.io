    		<div class="cont">Rama Seshan C received his B.E (EEE)  from SSN College of Engineering in 2017. He is now pursuing his PhD in the Electrical Engineering Dept of IIT Madras. His research area is geometric mechanics and control that involves applications of differential geometry, topology and dynamical systems to mechanics and control problems arising in robotics and other engineering systems. His other interests include mathematical analysis, mathematical logic,  theoretical physics,  history  of mathematics and pedagogy in teaching mathematics and science. He has been involved in organising various workshops in the field of robotics and stresses on the importance and the charm of the role of mathematics in understanding  robotics and controlling engineering systems. While he has taken several courses in pure mathematics ranging from real and functional analysis, algebra, differential geometry and topology, he also applies them to understand and gain insight into several interesting problems in physics and robotics.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>As you like it is an event with fun oriented mathematical games. It need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings. This event differ sharply from mathematical quiz in that mathematical quiz require specific mathematical expertise to complete, whereas it do not require a deep knowledge of mathematics to play. They are of deep interest in the field of recreational mathematics. These games have simple rules and match procedures with logic and recreation. If you and your team think that you deserve the honour, then this is your opportunity. Come and grab it! . 
  <br><b>Rules:-</b><br>
Team consists of maximum of three members. <br>
There will be ten event with recreational mathematics. <br>
Each event has separate points based on the performance. <br>
Final points will be the cumulative score of whole event. <br>
