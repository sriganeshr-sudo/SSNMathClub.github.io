    		<div class="cont">Rama Seshan C received his B.E (EEE)  from SSN College of Engineering in 2017. He is now pursuing his PhD 
          in the Electrical Engineering Dept of IIT Madras. His research area is geometric mechanics and control that involves applications 
          of differential geometry, topology and dynamical systems to mechanics and control problems arising in robotics and other 
          engineering systems. His other interests include mathematical analysis, mathematical logic, theoretical physics, history of 
          mathematics and pedagogy in teaching mathematics and science. He has been involved in organising various workshops in the 
          field of robotics and stresses on the importance and the charm of the role of mathematics in understanding  robotics and 
          controlling engineering systems. While he has taken several courses in pure mathematics ranging from real and functional analysis, 
          algebra, differential geometry and topology, he also applies them to understand and gain insight into several interesting problems 
          in physics and robotics.</div>

            <p>The game is basically dependent on how quickly your team can finish all the three tasks and how correctly you finish. You can only move on to the 
              next task only if you finish the preceding task and turn in and you cannot change your answers henceforth. You need to carry stationery such as pens, 
              pencils and erasers. Other event related stationery will be provided. The final evaluation will be based on how much you have done correctly within 
              each task and how quickly you have done them. The teams with maximum right answers and early to complete the tasks will be adjudged as 
              winners(1st place, 2nd place and 3rd place). There is no time limit for each individual task. The overall timing for the event will be 1 hour.
